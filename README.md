# Take the fun out of Yahtzee

The project was made to create a cheat sheet for Yahtzee. After the each time throwing the dice it returns the probabilities for each goal.

The current version is published on https://apps.handy-solutions.de/take-the-fun-out-of-yahtzee/yahtzee.html. It's pretty basic, but it does what it's designed for :).

Some more ideas to improve the app are:

- beautify the UI/make it more responsive
- more ideas are welcome!

Technically speaking I used Bootstrap4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) for the UI. To get the probabilities a simple AJAX call is made to an endpoint I am providing.

Personally speaking, I don't have time anymore to contribute to the project alone. But if somebody is interested in keeping this project alive, I am more than happy to help/contribute. The backend is no mystery, but right now I can not publish it because of crosslinks with other projects. I am working on seperation...
